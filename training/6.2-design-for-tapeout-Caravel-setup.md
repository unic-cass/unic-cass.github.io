In this lesson you will learn how to set up your environment in preparation for installing the design tool flow. We'll make sure that you have python Docker set up and tested. We also recommend installing klayout and Visual Studio Code but they're not required. we'll assume you are using a recent Linux installation like Ubuntu 20.04 or later.

To make sure the rest of the process goes smoothly, run these commands to [install some prerequisites](https://openlane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/installation/installation_ubuntu.html#installation-of-required-packages).

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt install -y build-essential python3 python3-venv python3-pip make git
```

Install Docker by running the following command:

```sh
sudo apt-get install docker.io
```

You can also consult the instructions to install docker from [<u>the official docker documentation</u>](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).\
Then test it by running:

```sh
sudo docker run hello-world
```

A successful installation of Docker would have this output:

```log
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.


To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub. (amd64)
3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it to your terminal.


To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
$ docker run -it ubuntu bash


Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:
https://hub.docker.com/

https://docs.docker.com/guides/getting-started/
```

We don't want to have to run Docker with sudo so run the following commands to add the docker group and yourself to it:

```bash
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
sudo reboot # REBOOT!
```

You can see I already have the docker group. Before testing make sure to log out then log in after adding yourself to the docker group then try running:

```sh
docker run hello-world
```

You should get the same result as before.

Klayout is a useful tool for viewing the GDS files produced by openlane. On Ubuntu 20.04, install it by running:

```sh
sudo app install klayout
```

On Ubuntu 22, the package is currently broken so you need to first download the package from Klayout website and then install it with dpkg command:

```sh
wget https://www.klayout.org/downloads/Ubuntu-22/klayout_0.28.10-1_amd64.deb
sudo apt-get install libqt5designer5 libqt5multimedia5 libqt5opengl5 libqt5multimediawidgets5 \
libqt5printsupport5 libqt5sql5 libqt5sql5 libqt5xmlpatterns5 libruby3.0
$ sudo dpkg -i klayout_0.28.10-1_amd64.deb
```

We won't show the install here because we're recording on Ubuntu 20.

We recommend Microsoft Visual Studio code for an editor. Go to the website and download it for your platform for Linux. After downloading, install it with dpkg:

```bash
curl -L 'https://code.visualstudio.com/sha/download?build=stable&os=linux-deb-x64' \
-o code.deb 
sudo dpkg -i code.deb
```

We can test Klayout and Visual Studio Code by starting them from the terminal try running:

```sh
klayout
```

and then:

```sh
code
```
