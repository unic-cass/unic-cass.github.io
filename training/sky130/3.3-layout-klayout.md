##### 2. Install gdsfactory for the PDK

For OpenPDKs version 2024.08.17 installed with Volare, you can install the lastest version of `pydantic` and `gdsfactory 8.7.3` for Klayout:

{: .shellcmd}
> ```bash
> pip3 install gdsfactory==8.7.3
> ```

> For Open PDKs with version smaller than 2024.08.17
> 
> By default, the open PDK installation already contains the tech files for Klayout. However, they are designed with a previous version of gdsfactory and pydantic. Therefore, it is neccessary to install the old version of gdsfactory and pydantic so that the pdk can be used with the PDK.

## Fixing Skywater 130nm to run with `Klayout`

The current version of OpenPDK for Sky130A has a bug in the configuration file when it is used with `Klayout`. Thefore, you have to run the following command to tweak the tech files for `Klayout`:

{: .shellcmd}
> ```bash
> sed -i -e 's/sky130/sky130A/' $PDK_ROOT/$PDK/libs.tech/klayout/tech/sky130A.lyt
> ```

This command will replace the string `sky130` into the string `sky130A` in `libs.tech/klayout/tech/sky130A.lyt`

{: .note-title}

{: .shellcmd}
> ```bash
> sed -i -e '/<?xml/d' $PDK_ROOT/$PDK/libs.tech/klayout/pymacros/sky130.lym
> ```
This command will delete this line `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>` in `libs.tech/klayout/pymacros/sky130.lym`


After that you can run `Klayout` without any problem.

### The problem explained

When you first run `Klayout` without the above fixes, you will have this message. The XML Parser complain about an invalid name in line 17.

{: .shellcmd}
> ```bash
> KLAYOUT_HOME=$PDK_ROOT/$PDK/libs.tech/klayout klayout -e
> ```

{: .cmdout}
> ```

We delete line 17 by using the following command:

{: .shellcmd}
> ```bash
> sed -i -e '/<?xml/d' $PDK_ROOT/$PDK/libs.tech/klayout/pymacros/sky130.lym 
> ```

Now run `Klayout` again in edit mode with the Skywater 130 PDK using this command:

{: .shellcmd}
> ```
> KLAYOUT_HOME=$PDK_ROOT/$PDK/libs.tech/klayout klayout -e
> ```

This time, the `Klayout` can run; however, when you create the layout with sky130 technology by selecting `File >> New Layout`. A new diaglog will open. In `New Layout` dialog, you select "sky130 - SkyWater 130nm technology" then press OK.

A new error will appear in the terminal as followings:

Klayout is searching for `sky130.lyp` but it cannot find it. The technology configuration file in `Klayout` is `libs.tech/klayout/tech/sky130A.lyt`. Take a look at the contents of this file:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<technology>
 <name>sky130</name>
 <description>SkyWater 130nm technology</description>
 <group/>
 <dbu>0.001</dbu>
 <default-grids/>
 <base-path/>
 <original-base-path>/home/cass/unic-cass/pdks/volare/sky130A/versions/6d4d11780c40b20ee63cc98e645307a9bf2b2ab8/sky130A/libs.tech/klayout/tech</original-base-path>
 <layer-properties_file>sky130.lyp</layer-properties_file>
 <add-other-layers>true</add-other-layers>
 ...
</technology>
```

Obviously, the configuration file use the string `sky130` for the name and the `layer-properties_file` is `sky130.lyp`. The problem is that the files are named `sky130A.lyp` in the `libs.tech/klayout/tech` folder. This leads to our solution to change the `name` into `sky130A` and the `layer-properties_file` into `sky130A.lyp`. This can be easily done by the following command:

{: .shellcmd}
> ```
> sed -i -e 's/sky130/sky130A/' $PDK_ROOT/$PDK/libs.tech/klayout/tech/sky130A.lyt
> ```

The contents of `libs.tech/klayout/tech/sky130A.lyt` after being modified:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<technology>
 <name>sky130A</name>
 <description>SkyWater 130nm technology</description>
 <group/>
 <dbu>0.001</dbu>
 <default-grids/>
 <base-path/>
 <original-base-path>/home/cass/unic-cass/pdks/volare/sky130A/versions/6d4d11780c40b20ee63cc98e645307a9bf2b2ab8/sky130A/libs.tech/klayout/tech</original-base-path>
 <layer-properties_file>sky130A.lyp</layer-properties_file>
 <add-other-layers>true</add-other-layers>
 ...
</technology>
```
After these modification, we can start using Klayout to create/edit layouts.
