Testing and sending your chip for manufacturing all depend on having a repository with the correct files in place. In this lesson, you'll learn how to use our caravelâ€™s template to get started. It will take you around 5 minutes and you'll need a GitHub account. If you don't have an account already, go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign up for a free account. Next go to the template repository. It's called the caravel user project.

You could use the template green button to create a new repository based on the template.

You'll need to fill in a name and an optional description. You should pick something that helps people know what your design is. So if you're working on an 8-bit CPU, you could call it an 8-bit CPU and click the create repository from the template button.
